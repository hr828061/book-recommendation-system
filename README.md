# Book Recommendation System


This project implements a book recommendation system using collaborative filtering and popularity-based approaches. By leveraging machine learning models, the system predicts the accuracy of book recommendations for users based on their preferences and behavior.

Features

Collaborative filtering: 

Recommends books based on similarities with other users' preferences.

Popularity-based recommendation: 

Suggests popular books irrespective of user preferences.
Machine learning model: 
redicts the accuracy of recommendations using ML algorithms.
Usage
Input Data: 
Provide user-book interaction data for training the recommendation system.
Training:
Train the collaborative filtering and popularity-based models using the provided data.
Recommendation:
Use the trained models to generate book recommendations for users.
Evaluation:
Evaluate the accuracy of recommendations using machine learning metrics.
